  [Node.py]: https://nodepy.org/

This is the [Node.py] Package Manager. It is recommended to install the package
manager with the remote install script available at
https://nodepy.org/install-pm.

    $ nodepy https://nodepy.org/install-pm

If you want to install from this repository instead, clone it and run:

    $ nodepy ./scripts/install

During development, it might be desirable to install nodepy-pm locally in
editable (development) mode:

    $ nodepy ./scripts/install -le
