Nppm can be configured in the Node.py configuration file under
`~/.nodepy/config`.

## Options

### `install.use_distlib`

The default value for this option is `true`. If this option is set to `false`,
nppm will create scripts itself rather than using the `distlib.scripts`
module. This is usually only relevant on Windows when the scripts generated
by distlib don't work (which can happen in sometimes).

When you disable this option, on Windows, nppm will create three files
instead of the `.exe` generated by distlib.

* `<script>.py` (the actual Python code that needs to be run for your script)
* `<script>.cmd` (a Windows batch file to invoke the `<script>.py`)
* `<script>` (a bash script to invoke the `<script>.py`)

Example:

    [install]
    use_distlib = false
